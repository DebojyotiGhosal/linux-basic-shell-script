# linux-basic-shell-script
This repo for a quick reference for the linux basic shell script.


The first line in any script will start with the shell requirement, like in which shell you want to script to be executed

e.g: #!/bin/bash 
Note- #! symbol know as shebang. The symbol indicates which interpreter, or which version of an interpreter, to use when running a script. It is also known as a "sharp-exclamation", "sha-bang", "hash-bang", or "pound-bang". The name is believed to have originated as a partial contraction of "SHarp bang" or "haSH bang".
